# Commit Booster 🚀

Automate meaningful GitHub commits to boost your contribution graph while maintaining good development practices.

## What This Does

This script helps you create consistent, meaningful commits that will make your GitHub contribution graph more active. Instead of making empty commits, it generates real project files and documentation updates.

## Quick Start

1. **Initialize the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run init
   ```

2. **Generate daily commits:**
   ```bash
   npm run daily
   ```

3. **Create multiple micro-commits:**
   ```bash
   npm run micro
   ```

## Commands

### `npm run daily`
- Creates a daily progress log entry
- Adds a random meaningful task to your TODO list
- Makes 2-3 commits with descriptive messages
- Perfect for daily use

### `npm run micro`
- Creates 4-5 small utility files
- Each file gets its own commit
- Simulates real development workflow
- Great for busy development days

### `npm run init`
- Initializes a git repository if one doesn't exist
- Sets up basic git configuration
- Prepares the project for commits

## How It Works

The script creates meaningful files and updates:
- **Daily Progress Log** - Tracks your project improvements
- **TODO List** - Maintains a list of tasks and improvements
- **Utility Files** - Creates helper modules and configurations
- **Documentation** - Updates project documentation

## Best Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Run `npm run daily` once per day for consistent activity
- Use `npm run micro` when working on actual projects
- Set your git email to match your GitHub account
- Push changes to GitHub regularly

❌ **Don't:**
- Make commits just for the sake of green squares
- Use this as a substitute for real development work
- Forget to push your commits to GitHub

## Configuration

Make sure your git configuration matches your GitHub account:

```bash
git config user.email "your-github-email@example.com"
git config user.name "Your GitHub Username"
```

## Example Output

```
✅ Daily commits generated successfully!
📝 Committed: Update daily progress log - 2025-07-21
📝 Committed: Add task: Code refactoring
📊 Commits today: 2
```

## Contributing

This project follows JavaScript ES6+ conventions and focuses on creating meaningful, small commits rather than large monolithic ones.

**Remember:** The goal is to supplement your real development work, not replace it. Use this tool to maintain consistency in your contribution graph while working on actual projects!
